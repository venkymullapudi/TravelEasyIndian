Sample static HTML site..

Choose between Train, Bus, Cab or Flight. From a place, to a place.


For those trying to use this:
1) You will need to add places in the app.
2) API's(for Train, Bus, Cab and Flight services) and a bit of php coding is needed to be included in this to make it a full fledged web app.
